Why do we use growth charts? \u00b6 By plotting a baby\u2019s growth on the chart, we can see whether it is following the expected pattern. The lines on a growth chart are called centile lines and are based on measurements from many babies. They show the optimal range of weights, lengths and head circumferences for healthy children, and how one baby compares with others of the same age and sex. For example, if your baby\u2019s weight is on the 25th centile, it means that if you lined up 100 babies of the same age and sex in order of weight, your baby would probably be number 25; 75 babies would be heavier than your baby, and 24 would be lighter. Weights, lengths and head circumferences that are anywhere within the centile lines on the chart are considered normal. Every baby is different (they come in all shapes and sizes!), so no two filled-in charts will look the same. Even twins may have different growth patterns. If a baby\u2019s growth pattern looks unusual, your health visitor or doctor may want to have a closer look to see why. This may involve taking more measurements, looking closely at feeding, or performing investigations. Most babies who have such investigations are found to be perfectly normal; however, it is important to check an unusual pattern on the chart to make sure. The UK-WHO growth charts \u00b6 The UK-WHO growth charts are based on measurements from healthy term babies (37 or more weeks gestation) collected by the World Health Organization (WHO) in six different countries. Healthy breastfed babies whose mothers did not smoke and who had access to good healthcare and nutrition were measured over time. The centile curves drawn using these measurements show how healthy babies are expected to grow, whatever their ethnic origin and whether breastfed or infant formula fed. For babies below 37 weeks of gestation, measurements are plotted on growth charts based on the birthweights of British infants who were born prematurely. Weighing and measuring \u00b6 Babies and children up to 2 years of age should be weighed without any clothes or nappy on, as this can make a big difference to the weight. Be aware that different scales sometimes give different readings, particularly if they are not electronic. If you notice this, try to take your baby/child to the same place for weighing each time. Up to the age of 2 years your child is measured for length (i.e. lying down) rather than height. Special equipment is needed to measure length accurately and this will be recommended by a health care professional if needed. Your child should not be wearing a nappy when his/her length is measured. How often to weigh \u00b6 It is normal for a baby to lose some weight in the first few days after birth. Your baby should be weighed in the first week as part of the assessment of feeding. Most babies get back to their birth weight by 2 weeks of age. This is a sign that feeding is going well and that your baby is healthy. After that, your baby will usually be weighed only when seen routinely, unless there is concern. Weighing your baby too often can cause unnecessary concern; the list below shows how often, as a maximum, babies should be weighed to monitor their growth. However, most children will not need to be weighed as often as this. Age Weigh no more often than 2 weeks to 6 months Once a month 6 to 12 months Once every 2 months Over 12 months Once every 3 months Many parents like to have their babies weighed more often than this. However, it is not always helpful and can cause unnecessary worry. For example, if one week your baby was weighed just after a big feed but the next week they were weighed after a long nap and before a feed, it could look as if they had not gained weight. Longer gaps between weights are more likely to show the true weight change. The time between weighing is longer for older babies because they are growing more slowly. Your health visitor or doctor may recommend more frequent weighing for children if there are concerns about their growth, health or if they have certain medical conditions. Remember that if you want advice you can always phone your health visitor or visit the clinic, without having your child weighed. Frequently asked questions \u00b6 I didn\u2019t breastfeed or I stopped early \u2013 are these charts still right for my baby? \u00b6 The charts show how breastfed babies grow if they are healthy and there are no problems. Babies grow most naturally when fed on breastmilk. If you use infant formula milk you want to know that your baby is still growing in the same healthy pattern that they would on breast milk. This chart helps you see if that is happening. My baby was born prematurely. Is this taken into account? \u00b6 If your baby was born early, weight and head circumference will be plotted on preterm charts until they are 2 weeks past your due date. This will help you and the health professionals tell how your baby is doing compared with other preterm babies. After this, weight and other measurements will be plotted on the main chart. Two centile values will be provided \u2013 one plotted at your baby\u2019s actual age and the other at his/her \u2018corrected\u2019 age (taking into account the number of weeks your baby was early). Why are there no centile lines on the charts between birth and 2 weeks? \u00b6 Most babies lose some weight after birth and regain it in the next 2 weeks, and growth patterns vary widely during this time; the growth chart cannot show this. Your baby\u2019s weight at about 2 weeks of age should be compared with their birth weight. How do I know my baby\u2019s weight is OK in the first 2 weeks? \u00b6 Weighing in the early days is important. Regaining weight after birth helps to show that your baby is healthy, and that feeding is going well. If your baby loses quite a lot of weight or is slow to regain their birth weight, this is a sign to look a little closer. If the weight loss seems a lot, your midwife or health visitor will calculate this as a percentage of their weight. If your baby has lost 10% or more (a tenth) of their birth weight, your midwife or health visitor will check how your baby is feeding. If you are breastfeeding or if you are giving infant formula milk, your midwife or health visitor will make suggestions about how you may help the baby feed more effectively to improve the weight gain and may recommend medical assessment. If any issues are identified a referral to specialist feeding services or a doctor may also be required. If you make a change to how you feed your baby, it may take a little time for their weight to improve. Your midwife or health visitor may want to weigh them again to follow their progress. My baby\u2019s weight was on one centile and now it is nearly down to the next line \u2013 is this normal? \u00b6 It is normal for the dots of your child\u2019s weight to \u2018wiggle\u2019 up and down a bit, or to move gradually from being near one centile to the next one (up or down). It is less common for a child\u2019s weight to cross two lines; if this happens your health visitor may want to keep a closer eye on your child for a while. My child was ill and lost some weight, what should I do? \u00b6 Children often lose some weight when they are not well. Once your child recovers from the illness, their weight should go back to the centile it was on before the illness within 2\u20133 weeks. If this does not happen, speak to your health visitor. The health visitor may measure your child\u2019s length or height or investigate other issues. When should length or height be measured? \u00b6 For babies and children under 2 years, length rather than height is measured. This can be helpful if there is any concern about weight gain. However, it is quite difficult to measure length accurately, so this will not be done every time your child is seen. It is not usually necessary to measure length or height if your child is growing as expected. My baby\u2018s head size has risen to the top of the centile chart \u2013 should I be worried? \u00b6 British children have relatively large heads compared to the WHO standard, particularly after the age of 6 months, so it is fairly common for the head centile to be at the very top of the chart or even above it. This should only cause concern if the head centile goes on rising after the first few weeks or of there are other concerning signs or symptoms.","title":"Information for Parents"},{"location":"clinician/chart-information-families/#information-for-parents","text":"","title":"Information for Parents"},{"location":"clinician/chart-information-families/#what-do-regular-measurements-tell-us","text":"Weighing and measuring helps us to check that your baby is growing and developing as expected.","title":"What do regular measurements tell us?"},{"location":"clinician/chart-information-families/#why-do-we-use-growth-charts","text":"By plotting a baby\u2019s growth on the chart, we can see whether it is following the expected pattern.

For further information and training materials see RCPCH website. Clothing and nappies When measuring children up to 2 years , remove all clothes and nappy. Children older than 2 years should wear minimal clothing only. Always remove the child's shoes. Weight: use only class III clinical electronic scales in metric setting. Length: (before 2 years of age): proper equipment is essential (length board or mat). Measurers should be trained. Height: (from 2 years): Position head and feet as illustrated with child standing as straight as possible. Measure height recorded to the last millimetre. A correctly installed or stadiometer or approved portable measuring device rigid rule with T piece is the only equipment that can be reliably used (see illustration). Head circumference: use a narrow plastic or paper tape to measure where the head circumference is greatest. When to weigh \u00b6 Babies should be weighed in the first week as part of the assessment of feeding and thereafter as needed. Recovery of birthweight indicates that feeding is effective and that the child is well. Once feeding is established, babies should usually be weighed at around 8, 12 and 16 weeks and 1 year at the time of routine immunisations. Weights measured too close together may be misleading, but if there are concerns about faltering growth , weight should be measured more often, but usually no more often than: daily if less than 1 month old weekly between 1\u20136 months old fortnightly between 6\u201312 months monthly from 1 year of age. When to measure length or height \u00b6 Length or height should be measured whenever there are any worries about a child\u2019s weight gain, growth or general health. Measure length until age 2; measure height after age 2. A child\u2019s height is usually slightly less than their length. Assessing weight loss after birth \u00b6 Weight gain in the early days varies a lot from baby to baby, however, by 2 weeks of age most babies will be on a centile close to their birth centile. Most babies lose some weight in the first 3-4 days after birth, but most have regained birth weight by 3 weeks of age. Careful clinical assessment and evaluation of feeding technique is indicated when weight loss exceeds 10% or recovery of birth weight is slow. Calculating the percentage weight loss is a useful way to identify babies who need assessment. Percentage weight loss can be calculated as follows: Weight loss = current weight\u2013birth weight Percentage weight loss = (Weight loss/ Birth weight) * 100% For example, a child born at 3.500kg who drops to 3.150kg at 5 days has lost 350g or 10%; in a baby born at 3.000kg, a 300g loss is 10%. What do the centiles mean? These charts indicate a child\u2019s size compared with children of the same age and maturity who have shown optimum growth. The chart also shows how quickly a child is growing. The centile lines on the chart show the expected range of weights and heights (or lengths); each describes the number of children expected to be below that line (e.g. 50% below 50th, 91% below the 91st). Children come in all shapes and sizes, but 99 out of 100 children who are growing optimally will be between the two outer lines (0.4th and 99.6th centiles); half will lie between the 25th and 75th centile lines. Being very small or very big can sometimes be associated with underlying illness. There is no single threshold below which a child\u2019s weight or height is definitely abnormal, but only 4 per 1000 children who are growing optimally are below the 0.4th centile, so these children should be assessed at some point to exclude any problems. Those above the 99.6th centile for height are almost always healthy. Also calculate BMI if weight and height centiles appear very different. What is a normal rate of weight gain and growth? \u00b6 Babies do not all grow at the same rate, so a baby\u2019s weight often does not follow a particular centile line, especially in the first year. Weight is most likely to track within one centile space (the gap between two centile lines, see diagram). In infancy, acute illness can lead to sudden weight loss and a weight centile fall but on recovery the child\u2019s weight usually returns to its normal centile within 2\u20133 weeks. However, a sustained drop through two or more weight centile spaces is unusual (fewer than 2% of infants) and should be carefully assessed by the primary care team, including measuring length/height. Because it is difficult to measure length and height accurately in pre-school children, successive measurements commonly show wide variation. If there are worries about growth, it is useful to measure on a few occasions over time; most healthy children will show a stable average position over time. UK children have relatively large heads compared to the WHO standard, particularly after the age of 6 months. After the age of 6 weeks a head circumference below the 2nd centile will be seen in only 1 in 250 children. A head circumference above the 99.6th centile, or crossing upwards through 2 centile spaces, should only cause concern if there is a continued rise after 6 months, or other signs or symptoms. Why do the length/height centiles change at 2 years? \u00b6 The growth standards show length data up to 2 years of age, and height from age 2 onwards. When a child is measured standing up, the spine is squashed a little, so their height is slightly less than their length; the centile lines shift down slightly at age 2 to allow for this. It is important that this difference does not worry parents; what matters is whether the child continues to follow the same centile after the transition. When is further assessment required in school aged children? \u00b6 If any of the following: Where weight or height or BMI is below the 0.4th centile, unless already fully investigated at an earlier age If the height centile is more than 3 centile spaces below the mid-parental centile. A drop in height centile position of more than 2 centile spaces, as long as measurement error has been excluded. Smaller centile falls or discrepancies between child\u2019s and mid-parental centile, if seen in combination, or if associated with possible underlying disease. If there are any other concerns about the child\u2019s growth. Calculations as yet not implemented in the API \u00b6 Weight\u2013height to BMI conversion chart \u00b6 BMI = weight in kg /(height in m)2 BMI indicates how heavy a child is relative to his or her height and is the simplest measure of thinness and fatness from the age of 2, when height can be measured fairly accurately. In a child over 2 years of age, the BMI centile is a better indicator of overweight or underweight than the weight centile; a child whose weight is average for their height will have a BMI between the 25th and 75th centiles, whatever their height centile. BMI above the 91st centile suggests that the child is overweight; a child above the 98th centile is very overweight (clinically obese). BMI below the 2nd centile is unusual and may reflect undernutrition. Percentage median BMI \u00b6 Here the child or young person's BMI is compared with the median value for age and sex and expressed as a percentage. It is used prinicipally in risk assessment in eating disorders. Predicting adult height \u00b6 Parents like to know how tall their child will be as an adult. The child\u2019s most recent height centile (aged 2\u20134 years) gives a good idea of this for healthy children. Plot this centile on the adult height predictor to the right of the height chart to find the average adult height for children on this centile. Four out of five children will have adult heights that are within 6cm above or below this value. Adult Height Predictor This allows you to predict the child\u2019s adult height based on their current height, but with a regression adjustment to allow for the tendency of very tall and short children to be less extreme in height as adults. Four girls out of five will have an adult height within \u00b16 cm of the predicted adult height.","title":"Chart information for Health staff"},{"location":"clinician/chart-information-health-staff/#chart-information-for-health-staff","text":"","title":"Chart information for Health staff"},{"location":"clinician/chart-information-health-staff/#how-the-charts-work","text":"The UK\u2013WHO growth chart combines World Health Organization (WHO) standards with UK 1990 preterm and birth data.

It is calculated as the number of days / 365.25. The extra 0.25 is to account for the leap year which comes round every 4 years. A pregnancy lasts 40 weeks (280 days). This is calculated from the date of the baby's mother's last menstrual period. In fact, from that date, ovulation occurs midway through the following cycle (on average 14 days into a 28 day cycle). This means that from conception, a pregnancy actually lasts only 266 days. Babies are considered to have been born 'term' if delivered anywhere from 37 to 42 weeks gestation (3 weeks before to 2 weeks after the due date). The due date is referred to as the Estimated Date of Delivery (EDD). Gestational Age / Post-menstrual Age \u00b6 Gestational age at birth is the gestation at which the infant was born, and represents the number of weeks (and extra days) since the last menstrual period. It is often shortened to gestational age, at birth being assumed. After delivery, the gestational age of preterm infants is often tracked by clinicians in addition to chronological age (and is sometimes referred to as post-menstrual age). Chronological Decimal Age \u00b6 This is the time elapsed since birth, in years, irrespective of the gestational age at birth. For example the chronological age at EDD, i.e. at 40 weeks gestation, of a baby born at 24 weeks gestation would be 16 weeks or (16 x 7)/365.25 = 0.31 years. Corrected Decimal Age \u00b6 This is the age of a child born preterm calculated from their due date rather than their birth date , which will be earlier than their due date. This adjusts for the immaturity of preterm babies being born early. The process is referred to as gestational age correction, and prior to digital growth charts it was a manual process. Prior to digital growth charts, the convention was to apply gestational age correction to all babies born before 37 weeks gestation. For those born at 32-36 weeks the correction was applied until the baby was 1 year old, and below 32 weeks until they were 2 years old (based on corrected rather than chronological age). Now that the correction is applied automatically by the API, the Project Board decided that it made no sense to stop the correction at arbitrary ages, and it should be applied throughout childhood. (Of course, the difference between corrected and uncorrected age becomes less apparent as the child gets older.) A further Project Board decision was to extend the gestational age correction to all children, including those born at term. This represents a departure from the previous practice of using a common reference for all term gestation babies, averaged across gestations 37-42 weeks.

Digital Growth Charts include recommended SNOMED-CT clinical terminology to guide persistence of the returned values Q: How do I get the RCPCH Digital Growth Charts in my EPR? \u00b6 A : As a first step, we would suggest to discuss with the CIO (Chief Information Officer) and CCIO (Chief Clinical Information Officer) at your trust, or their equivalents in your place of work. Hopefully this can lead on to further discussion with the IT team at your place of work, which should hopefully establish lines of communication with the supplier of the Electronic Patient Record (EPR). Many EPR suppliers will have already started the process of integrating the RCPCH dGC API into their product, and we are happy to assist vendors with integration once they purchase a subscription. Q: How much do the RCPCH dGC APIs cost? \u00b6 A : The APIs themselves are run on a sustainable non-profit basis by the RCPCH, which is a charitable organisation. The aim is for modest revenues from the API to be fed back into development of future APIs and new features. Pricing tiers for the API are shortly to be published, and usually the EPR vendor or integration service would pay for this directly, however the costs are likely to be passed on to you, the customer. Pricing depends on the volume of requests that the vendor requires and the amount of support they need. The process of integrating the API into an existing EPR product is technically straightforward and the amount of work is modest. EPR suppliers may of course levy a fee for this additional integration work, however once this has been done once for a product, there should be minimal or zero additional work to roll out to other sites, so you should check whether the vendor has already deployed the dGC elsewhere. Q: Can I try out the dGC APIs? \u00b6 A : Yes, you can use the demo site at https://growth.rcpch.ac.uk/ to evaluate the service. Q: If we have a calculated centile from the API then why do we need the traditional 'curved-lines' growth charts at all? \u00b6 A : Good question. Maybe, in time, this style of chart will no longer be needed. Maybe in time they will be replaced by SDS charts, which would allow us to view height, weight, head circumference, and BMI all on one chart too! The traditional growth charts were actually a form of 'paper calculator' for the centile values. The clinician plotted the age and the height/weight data and then looked for which centile lines it was between, and this was the data that the clinician read off and recorded. We would also keep the charts for future plotting. The Growth Charts API obviates the need for this step since we calculate the centiles for you. However, another important function of the chart was to visualise trends in the growth. Our API does not do this, so there will be a need for some form of chart to visualise the trend. Initially we expect that clinical users will want to see the traditional growth chart, out of simple familiarity. But in time we think that researchers may develop better visualisations of the trend in centiles/SDS that don't have to come on such confusing curvy charts.

Datasets or growth references are, in general, relating to the population of a geographical area (UK90, US Centers for Disease Control or CDC 2000) or are specific to a particular condition or disease state. As part of this project we have attempted to catalogue the available datasets or growth references, internationally. The UK references are only usable under MRC licence. The WHO or CDC data are freely available open data. This is not an exhaustive list but the aim is to be a repository for all LMS references, not only for growth but for all other physiological parameters. This collection is incomplete at present, but we welcome submissions to the repository to build the collection - please send pull requests or contact us on growth.digital@rcpch.ac.uk. The codebase we have built is capable of utilising any reference or dataset, but there might need to be small configurations necessary to allow for the differences between them. Info We are working on a 'standard format' of JSON that will contain reference metadata as well as the LMS tables themselves, in a 'key-value' format that makes programmatic lookups consistent across different references. Along with the data file, we request the following: file name, parameters described, acknowledgement text, authors, publication / reference.

Any child born after that date should be plotted on a UK-WHO growth chart. Children born before May 11th 2009 are plotted on British 1990 (UK90) charts and subsequent measurements must be plotted using those charts. After age 4 the two charts are the same. The LMS Method \u00b6 It is now common practice to express child growth status in the form of SD scores - the number of standard deviations away from the mean (also known as a z-score). The SD score can be converted to a centile. The LMS method provides a way of obtaining normalized growth centiles from a reference dataset, applying smoothing and extrapolation such that the resulting L, M and S curves contain the information to draw any centile curve, and to convert measurements (even extreme values) into exact SD scores. The growth reference is summarised by a table of LMS values at a series of ages. How the LMS method is used \u00b6 Look up in the LMS table for the relevant measurement (e.g. height) the age and sex-specific values of L, M and S for the child. If the child's age falls between the tabulated ages, use cubic interpolation to obtain values for the child's exact age. To obtain the z-score, plug the LMS values with the child's measurement into the formula: Growth References \u00b6 This is a growing list of growth references for children. These cover a number of specific medical conditions as well as a range of different physiological parameters. It will continue to be added to as the data become available. As a side-project of this work we are interested in collating an international library of growth references in computable format, which is at https://github.com/rcpch/growth-references and further details are available in that repository. If you have a reference which you would like us to add, please contact us on growth.digital@rcpch.ac.uk Gold Standard \u00b6 The preceding 'gold standard' for LMS calculation was LMSgrowth , an Excel add-in written in Visual Basic by Huiqi Pan and Tim Cole (copyright Medical Research Council 2002\u201310). Results from RCPCHGrowth agree with LMSgrowth to 3 decimal places, though beyond this there are discrepancies. Part of the reason for this relates to the decimal age calculation - in LMS Growth months and weeks are handled differently to RCPCHGrowth which uses the python date-utils library to calculate differences between dates. Interpolation \u00b6 The process involves the following steps: Calculate decimal age in years (age in days / 365.25, to account for leap years) Look up nearest decimal ages in the reference data and read off associated L, M and S values If necessary use interpolation to obtain L, M and S values for the required age Substitute L, M and S in the final equation to generate an SDS. In most situations, the decimal age of the child falls between the available decimal ages in the reference data. If that is the case, an interpolation needs to be performed on the ages either side of the child's age, and the same applied in turn to the L, M and S values associated with each of the ages below and above. Cubic Interpolation \u00b6 In most circumstances cubic interpolation is used - this involves identifying 2 ages below and 2 ages above the child's age and substitution the following equation: If t\u2080 , t\u2081 , t\u2082 , t\u2083 , y\u2080 , y\u2081 , y\u2082 , y\u2083 , are given, and t\u2080 < t\u2081 < t\u2082 < t\u2083 , t is in the range of [ t\u2081 , t\u2082 ], the cubic interpolation of y for t is: dt = ( t-t \u2081)/0.5 a\u2083 = y\u2081 y=a {0}dt^{3}+a dt^{2}+a_{2}dt+a^{3} Note: this derived formula is equivalent to the above cubic interpolation only when the age interval is 0.5. Alternatively, it is possible to use the CubicSpline function from the SciPy interpolate package, or the interpolate.splev function - details can be found in the comments in the sds_calculations.py module. In testing our findings were that the original Cole method above ran faster than the Scipy interpolate functions with the same level of accuracy. Linear Interpolation \u00b6 Where a child's measurement falls close to a reference threshold and there is only one age below or above them, linear rather than cubic interpolation is used. Here, the interp1d function from the Scipy has been used to keep code less verbose. Reference Thresholds \u00b6 It is documented in several places how there are age thresholds for different measurements. This is either due to a lack of measurements, or an overlap in references. Because the different datasets overlap, there is a certain amount of logic throughout the functions to ensure that the correct reference is selected. The thresholds are: length runs from 25 weeks to 2 years. There is overlap here where children are measured standing (height) rather than lying (length), and therefore 2 LMS values for the same age. The functions have a default_to_youngest_reference flag which by default is false. This means that a measurement at exactly 2 years is treated as height. From 2 years, the data continues as height to 4 years where again there are 2 values. This is the join between the WHO 2006 and UK90 data. Again here, default is to the older UK90 reference, but this can be overridded by the user if they wish. Length/Height appears as such on charts, and can be found simply as 'height' as a parameter for simplicity. weight appears as 'weight' as a parameter and is continuous from 23 weeks gestation through to 20 y for both sexes. There are overlaps as with height, between UK90 preterm, UK-WHO infant and child and again UK90 child datasets. BMI appears as 'bmi' as a parameter and is a calculated value requiring height in metres and weight in kilograms, expressed as kg/m\u00b2. Reference data for BMI are available from 2 weeks of age in the UK-WHO dataset, up to 20 years. Overlaps, as with height and weight, exist at 2 and 4 years. Head circumference is referred to as occipitofrontal circumference and appears as an 'ofc' parameter. Reference data exist for both sexes from 23 weeks gestation to 17 years in girls, and 18 years in boys. There are overlaps as above where datasets meet. Prematurity and Term \u00b6 An infant is considered premature (preterm) if born below 37 weeks gestation. The limits of viability may stretch occasionally below 23 weeks, the reference data stops here. It is important to note that reference data on length do not exist until 25 weeks gestation, or 42 weeks gestation in the case of BMI. For babies born premature, a gestation is provided in weeks and supplemental days, which together with the birth and measurement dates, can be used to calculate a corrected decimal age. The reference data for these are found in the uk_who_0_20_preterm.json file. Removal of Term Dates Averaging \u00b6 The entire Term period (from 37-42 weeks gestation) used to be defined as a decimal age of exactly 0 years, and the Growth Chart Reference Group at the inception of the UK-WHO paper charts had previously stipulated that no growth data should be reported over the 2 week period after delivery in term infants. The growth chart reference data covering this Term period used to be averaged across the period, so that regardless of actual gestational age, all term-born children were considered to be the same gestation, for paper and PDF growth charts. However, during the development of the Digital Growth Charts, the dGC Project Board determined that since there is now evidence that there is a difference between the outcomes of children born as early term and late term, and also since the dGC makes it easy to correct for all gestational ages, that we should abolish the 'averaging' effect of the concept of term, and simply correct all children for gestational age.

Managing library / dependencies versions \u00b6 If you pip install all of the dependencies in requirements.txt globally on your machine, then you can encounter problems if you develop other Python applications on the same machine, for example if ydifferent projects need different versions of the same library. The solution we have chosen is to use pyenv-virtualenv which is an extension to pyenv which helps you to manage separate 'environments' for each Python project you work on.

A large amount of documentation has been produced to guide the clinically safe design and rendering of UK growth charts. Implementation support service The RCPCH can assist in both the technical implementation and clinical assurance of any new charts implementations, to ensure adherence to the Project Board specification, a clinically safe user interface, and likely clinician user acceptance. Please contact us to discuss your needs on commercial@rcpch.ac.uk Understanding UK-WHO \u00b6 The UK growth charts are made up of 4 datasets taken from 2 growth references (see clinical documentation for more detail). The UK90 preterm dataset runs from 23 weeks gestation to 42 weeks postmenstrual age as length (from 25 weeks), weight and head circumference. The WHO 2006 dataset runs from 2 weeks of age to 2 years of age as length, weight, BMI and head circumference. The WHO 2006 dataset continues as height (now measured standing ) from 2 years to 4 years of age The UK90 dataset picks up until 20y (head circumference to 17 in girls and 18 y in boys) Implications for charting digitally \u00b6 These datasets all overlap, and therefore when plotting them, they must be passed to charting packages as 4 individual series. This means they will appear as discontinuous, with breaks in the lines where they meet/overlap. There is a natural step at each of these time points which must be respected. If all 4 datasets are presented 0-20y as a continuous dataset, chart packages will interpolate the gaps and the intentional 'step' will be lost. The API endpoint returns the chart data in an array of arrays. The first level array represents the 9 centiles [0.4, 2, 9 , 25, 50, 75, 91, 98, 99.6], with each centile in turn having a nested array of 4 arrays of data, one for each dataset (see below). The individual data points are reported as float values for x and y coordinates. X corresponds to decimal age, y to the measurement value of the chart requested. The chart data is only returned for the measurement method requested - if only height is supplied, only height centile data will be returned. In addition to the centile data, the growth data presented to the endpoint in the request are returned as an array of x and y values. Specifications for implementing your own charting \u00b6 React component reference charting implementation Making growth charts that adhere to the specifcation and are clinical safe and usable is not completely straightforward. That's why we have built a reference implementation of the charts, as a permissively licensed React component so that you can use it in your own application. Chart plotting \u00b6 Provide the facility to toggle between height chart and weight chart or display together. Offer option of BMI and head circumference charts for health staff use. Allow the chart to be scaleable, i.e. zooming in or out, while maintaining variable, visible axes or offer a variety of age ranges displayed to optimise data view. Provide option of Z-score (SD) plots for health staff use (see below). Provide help / information facility to access instructions drawn from the RCPCH educational materials (see separate documents: information for parents, information for health staff). When plotting centile charts \u00b6 Certain key presentation principles should be included: Use nine-centile format (see below). Scale different elements of the chart to best display information in each period. Use fortnightly grid points to 6 months, monthly thereafter. Either show exact age and centile band (see below) when hovering over a point or show in an embedded table. Data points should not be joined by lines. There should be a toggle button to allow the user to see the chronological and corrected ages separately or together. Omit grid lines, which are only useful for manual plotting, and the Y axis can be inconspicuous. When Plotting Z-score (SD) charts \u00b6 Z-score centile charts may be created with age on the X axis and Z-score on the Y axis \u2013 this converts the centile curves to horizontal straight lines. All available measurements (weight, height, head, BMI ) should be plotted as series on the same chart with consistent colour coding of the different series (e.g. weight could always be red and height blue etc). The data points may be joined by fine lines. The Y axis should cross the X axis at Z = 0 and have horizontal centile lines at intervals of 0.67 Z between -2.67 and 2.67. Adjusting for Gestation at birth \u00b6 On the centile chart it should be made clear that allowance has been made for varying age of gestation at birth by offering the option of plotting at chronological age with a circle as well as gestational age (age \u2013 number of weeks premature) with a cross . If plotted together, they should be joined by a line. An option should be offered to toggle between the plotted chronological, corrected ages and both. Gestation Age Correction through the life course The standard has recently changed such that now gestational age is taken into account, even when born at gestational ages regarded as term, and across the whole lifespan. This change was adopted because digital charting makes gestational age correction much easier to do, in fact it is now a completely automated process because of the the dGC API. (Note that this is different from paper charts, where gestational age correction was manual and therefore was only done up to 1 or 2 years depending on the degree of prematurity). Examples \u00b6 Example Gestation Old policy New policy 39 weeks 4 days Plot on 'Term' reference 'Term' reference has been abandoned in favour of plotting on UK90 preterm chart up till corrected gestational age of 42 weeks 0 days 26 weeks 0 days Gestational age correction applied until 2 (corrected) years old Correct for the whole life span 35 weeks 6 days Gestational age correction applied until 1 (corrected) year old Correct for the whole life span Definitions: Gestation at birth Weeks premature Gestational age Chronological age Gestational adjustment option provided for all birth gestations and continues indefinitely. On a Z-score plot the gestationally adjusted Z-score should be plotted against actual (chronological) age with a label on the plot specifying the number of weeks premature. Essential standards for rendering \u00b6 Whilst it is not essential to show the whole life course when plotting measurements against centile lines, the rendering of the centile lines and the plots must meet the following design standards. Centiles should be clearly labelled. Overlap between datasets for each centile should be clearly visible and no interpolation function should be used to attempt to link them. The 0.4th, 9th, 50th, 91st and, 99.6th centiles should all be dashed lines ( not dotted, not continuous). The 2nd, 25th, 75th and 98th centiles should be continuous lines (thin). Axes should be clearly labelled (Height/Length in cm, Weight in kg, body mass index in kg/m2, head circumference in cm, age in years). X axis (age in years) increments should be monthly under the age of 2 y, 3 monthly over the age of 2 years. Measurements (height, weight, etc) should be to one decimal place. Centiles should be reported as integers, except if >99 or <1. If outside threshold, they should be reported as >99.6 or <0.4.

However there are several important considerations which we believe would more than negate any saving made. We have open sourced the API in order to align with our policy on transparency and clinical safety, however we advise that you do not self host it. Only the version deployed and managed by the RCPCH team is warranted to be correct. Clinical Safety Risk WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND NOT TO SELF HOST THE SERVER FOR PRODUCTION/CLINICAL/LIVE USE. 1. If self hosting you would not have a warranty from RCPCH and your organisation would therefore be liable for misconfigurations in the server leading to clinical mishap.

LINK TO PRICING By using the RCPCH-provided API you avoid all that requirement and use our commodity server. Q: Is entering a gestational age mandatory? \u00b6 A : Gestational age is not mandatory for the API to return a value. If it is not supplied then the child will be assumed to be born at 40 weeks and therefore for the UK-WHO charts, the standard term references will be used for calculations and charts. From a DPCHR implementer perspective, if a birth notification has not flowed into the DPCHR, suppliers will need to require parents to enter it. [DPCHR]: Digital Paediatric Child Health Record [DCB0129]: (Data Coordination Board) Standard 0129 [DCB0160]: (Data Coordination Board) Standard 0160 Q: What development effort is required to integrate this API into an app or Electronic Patient Record? \u00b6 A : Minimal development is required. The tricky stuff (calculating centiles from complex statistical tables, selecting the correct UK90 or WHO references for age, and gestational age correction) is all done for you. The data returned will be the correct centiles, which can be displayed to the user. Producing a visual \u2018growth chart\u2019 with this data on is a little more involved, however we have tried to make the process as easy as possible by building API endpoints which return the coordinate data from which to build the chart lines, and also we\u2019ve made an open source library which takes that source data and makes a chart for you. It\u2019s built in React and is MIT licensed, but if you are using another technology then you can inspect the source and use that to build your own client. We are keen to build a \u2018catalogue\u2019 of chart clients so other open source clients are very welcome and we will help you build and test them! Q: Is corrected gestational age passed back by the API, or do implementers have to calculate it? \u00b6 A : Yes, corrected age is passed back by the API, if a gestational age is included in the request. Warning The API can only correct for gestational age if a gestational age has been supplied! This correction is applied up to the corrected age of 1 year for preterm children born above 32 weeks, and to the corrected age of 2 years for preterm children born below 32 weeks, which is accepted standard practice among paediatricians. Q: Does my application need to validate inputs? \u00b6 A : The API has validation and error handling for out-of-range requests, but it is good practice for the front-end software to also reject input values that are out of range since this feedback can be shown to the user, by the application. Q: Is there a source from where we can get a list of extreme input values to use for our validation? \u00b6 A : Yes, we have included one in our source code: Validation Constants . This is what is used internally to validate API inputs and also used by the internal rcpchgrowth Python module to validate inputs to the Measurement class. Q: Would it be good enough to plot the returned centile values on a pre-prepared image of a growth chart? \u00b6 A : Maybe. It would depend on the implementation. Images of charts are definitely not good enough for calculating a centile from, although many GP software packages do it this way, it's poor practice and it's why the API needed to exist in the first place. BUT, since we are calculating the centiles for you, then the chart is only for displaying the trend. An image could be used, but we would advise against it generally. The problem with images is that it is very easy to accidentally have an offset or scaling error that means that some plotted points are in the right place, and some are not. Best practice is always to use the same vector graphic tooling to both construct the lines and plot the points, to avoid offsets/scaling inaccuracy. If you are using an image (please don't) then you must ensure you're selecting the correct one for the data you're presenting, and that the scaling and offset is not just programmed to be correct, but clinically tested to be correct!","title":"FAQs for Integrators"},{"location":"integrator/faqs-for-integrators/#faqs-for-integrators","text":"In our documentation we have used the term Integrator to refer to a person or team who is integrating the API into a product or service.

To overcome this, in your application: foobar:~foo$ cd node_modules/react foobar:~foo$ npm link In the root folder of your chart library: foobar:~foo$ npm link react Repeat the same for react-dom ensuring all the package versions are the same for your app and the library. In this way, you can make changes to the chart package and they will appear in your app after npm run build and refresh your app. If the invalid hooks error persists inspite of this, a further fix involves deleting the node_modules folder in the @rcpch/digital-growth-charts-react-component-library folder within node_modules in the client. Structure \u00b6 This library has been written in Typescript. The main component is RCPCHChart , which takes the following props : { title : string , subtitle : string , measurementMethod : 'height' | 'weight' | 'ofc' | 'bmi' , sex : 'male' | 'female' , measurementsArray : [ Measurement ], reference : 'uk-who' | 'turner' | 'trisomy-21' , width : number , height : number , chartStyle : ChartStyle , axisStyle : AxisStyle , gridlineStyle : GridlineStyle , centileStyle : CentileStyle , measurementStyle : MeasurementStyle } The Measurement interface is structured to reflect the JSON Measurement object which is returned by the API. The RCPCHChart component uses the reference prop to determine which chart to render. So far, 3 references are supported: UK-WHO, Turner's Syndrome and Trisomy 21 (Down's Syndrome). The reference data for the centiles are included in the library in plottable format in the chartdata folder. The Measurement interface structure is: interface Measurement { birth_data : { birth_date : Date , estimated_date_delivery : Date , estimated_date_delivery_string : string , gestation_weeks : number , gestation_days : number , sex : 'male' | 'female' }, child_observation_value : { measurement_method : 'height' | 'weight' | 'bmi' | 'bmi' , observation_value : number , observation_value_error : string }, measurement_dates : { chronological_calendar_age : string , chronological_decimal_age : number , clinician_decimal_age_comment : string corrected_calendar_age : string , corrected_decimal_age : number , corrected_gestational_age : { corrected_gestation_weeks : number corrected_gestation_days : number }, lay_decimal_age_comment : string , observation_date : Date }, measurement_calculated_values : { chronological_centile : number , chronological_centile_band : string , chronological_measurement_error : string , chronological_sds : number , corrected_centile : number , corrected_centile_band : string , corrected_measurement_error : string , corrected_sds : number measurement_method : 'height' | 'weight' | 'bmi' | 'ofc' , } plottable_data : { centile_data : { chronological_decimal_age_data : { age_error : null , age_type : \"chronological_age\" | \"corrected_age\" , calendar_age : string , centile_band : string , clinician_comment : string , lay_comment : string , observation_error : null , observation_value_error : null , x : number y : number }, corrected_decimal_age_data : { age_error : null , age_type : \"chronological_age\" | \"corrected_age\" , calendar_age : string , centile_band : string , clinician_comment : string , lay_comment : string , observation_error : null , observation_value_error : null , x : number y : number } }, sds_data : { chronological_decimal_age_data : { age_error : null , age_type : \"chronological_age\" | \"corrected_age\" , calendar_age : string , centile_band : string , clinician_comment : string , lay_comment : string , observation_error : null , observation_value_error : null , x : number y : number }, corrected_decimal_age_data : { age_error : null , age_type : \"chronological_age\" | \"corrected_age\" , calendar_age : string , centile_band : string , clinician_comment : string , lay_comment : string , observation_error : null , observation_value_error : null , x : number y : number } } } } ``` The styling components allow the user to customise elements of the chart: Chart styles control the chart and the tooltips ``` js interface ChartStyle { backgroundColour ?: string , width ?: number , height ?: number , padding ?: requires { left ?: number , right ?: number , top ?: number , bottom ?: number }, titleStyle ?: requires { name ?: string , colour ?: string , size ?: number , weight ?: 'bold' | 'italic' | 'regular' } subTitleStyle ?: requires { name ?: string , colour ?: string , size ?: number , weight ?: 'bold' | 'italic' | 'regular' },, tooltipBackgroundColour ?: string , tooltipStroke ?: string , tooltipTextStyle ?: requires { name ?: string , colour ?: string , size ?: number , weight ?: 'bold' | 'italic' | 'regular' } termFill ?: string , termStroke ?: string , infoBoxFill ?: string , infoBoxStroke ?: string infoBoxTextStyle ?: requires { name ?: string , colour ?: string , size ?: number , weight ?: 'bold' | 'italic' | 'regular' } toggleButtonInactiveColour : string // relates to the toggle buttons present if age correction is necessary toggleButtonActiveColour : string toggleButtonTextColour : string } Note for the tooltips and infobox text sizes, these are strokeWidths, not point sizes as the text here is svg.

Corrected ages are always rendered as crosses. Circles for chronological ages are preferred. interface MeasurementStyle { measurementFill ?: string , measurementSize ?: number // this is an svg size } At the moment, only standard centile measurement plots are supported, but in future it is expected SDS charts will be added for all references. In time more props can be added if users request them. If you have requests, please post issues on our github or contribute. Acknowledgements \u00b6 This Typescript library was built from the starter created by Harvey Delaney The charts are built using Victory Charts for React. We tried several different chart packages for React, but we chose Victory because of their documentation and their ability to customise components. The chart data bundled in is subject to licence. If you wish to use this software, please contact the RCPCH. Background \u00b6 Why a Chart library? \u00b6 In the process of building the API, we realised that it would not be easy for developers not familiar with growth charts to produce them. Even if the API were to send all the values to render centiles and growth measurement points in plottable format (which it does), the challenge of rendering these remains complicated. For example, charts typically have 9 main centile lines (though there are other formats), each of which can be rendered as a series. However the UK-WHO chart is made of several growth references, each from different datasets, and it is a stipulation that they must not overlap - this means for the four datasets which make up UK-WHO, the developer must render 36 separate 'sections' of centile lines correctly. Even then, there are certain rules which are key, published by the RCPCH project board. These relate to usability of the charts. For example, the 50th centile should be de-emphasised. These and other rules are listed on the RCPCH Github Given the complexity, we decided to create a React component library for developers to use. We designed it to be customisable for those that wanted to use it, but also as a demonstration for developers who wanted to build the charts themselves from the ground up. If you want to see how the library is implemented, we have built a client for the RCPCHGrowth API in React, which can be found here . Why use React? \u00b6 React is a popular UI library for Javascript. It has endured well and seems like a popular choice for developers. Importantly, unlike some other Javascript frameworks which are primarily designed for Single Page Applications, React doesn't expect to have the entire webpage to itself. It can be used as a small component in any other web page, even if the main framework being used is something completely different. Tell us what you think Let us know what you think of our design decisions, on this or any other area of the dGC Project, by chatting to us on our dGC Forum What about other frameworks/UI libraries? \u00b6 If you need us to develop a charting component in a different language or framework, we may be able to do this with you or your company, however we would need to discuss the requirements and quote for this service. You should be aware that all such RCPCH-developed artefacts will also be open source. We will of course ensure that the licensing of such open source components is compatible with commercial use. Contact us To contact us for this service, email commercial@rcpch.ac.uk Contributing \u00b6 see Contributing How to contribute \u00b6 Fork the repository to your own GitHub account Set up your development environment (ideally using our instructions here for maximum compatibility with our own development environments) Note that running the chart package and react client locally will cause a conflict within react if multiple versions are running. A fix for this can be found in the react client readme.MD Ideally, you should have discussed with our team what you are proposing to change, because we can only accept pull requests where there is an accepted need for that new feature or fix. We can discuss with you how we would recommend to implement the new feature, for maximum potential 'mergeability' of your PR. Once the work is ready to show us, create a pull request on our repo, detailing what the change is and details about the fix or feature. PRs that affect any 'mission critical' part of the code will need suitable tests which we can run.

The Royal College Digital Growth Charts Team is required to adhere to National Information standards created and monitored via the Data Coordination Board (DCB) within NHS Information Standards frameworks. The mechanisms used are approved process Clinical Risk Management System compliance documents. This Clinical Risk Management System will be reviewed periodically to ensure that: changes in working practices are incorporated. issues identified through an established internal audit programme are addressed. the safety approach continues to adhere to the requirements of applicable international standards. the system continues to protect the safety of patients in a complex and changing environment.

The Clinical Safety Officer (CSO) for the Organisation is responsible for ensuring the safety of a healthcare IT system through the application of clinical risk management. The Clinical Safety Officer must hold a current registration with an appropriate professional body relevant to their training and experience. They also need to be suitably trained and qualified in risk management or have an understanding in principles of risk and safety as applied to healthcare IT systems. The Clinical Safety Officer ensures that the processes defined by the clinical risk management system are followed. DCB : Data Coordination Board Healthcare IT Clinical Risk Management (CRM) Governance Arrangements \u00b6 The responsibility for healthcare IT CRM within the Organisation resides with the Clinical Safety Officer Organisational management of healthcare IT related risks is as per the existing management arrangements as specified in the Organisation\u2019s Risk Management Strategy. Clinical Risk Management Team Organisation Chart \u00b6 The RCPCH's team is not yet of a size that it requires an org chart to explain. Left here as a placeholder in case an org chart is needed in the future. Personnel \u00b6 Clinical Safety Officer \u00b6 Dr Marcus Baw Senior Clinical Adviser \u00b6 Dr Simon Chapman Chief Technology Officer \u00b6 Andrew Palmer Chief Executive Officer \u00b6 Overall governance for the RCPCH Digital Growth Charts project is provided not by a single individual, but by the RCPCH Digital Growth Charts Project Board, which is composed of senior leadership within the RCPCH and the most eminent clinicians in the field of Growth charts. Governance \u00b6 Governance for patient safety within the Organisation is provided through the following forums: Clinical Risk Meetings \u00b6 Clinical Safety is discussed as a fixed item on the two-weekly Sprint Planning Meeting at which the project is planned and priorities set for the next sprint of development. In the event of an urgent clinical safety issue or incident, a supplementary Clinical Risk meeting is held at the earliest possible time. Open, transparent public Issue tracking \u00b6 Open, public issue tracking ensures the widest possible reporting base, and unparalleled access to report issues compared to the majority of Health IT systems. These Issues, tracked in GitHub, directly form part of the development workflow used by the clinical and technical teams. Healthcare IT Clinical Risk Management Deliverables \u00b6 Clinical Risk Management File (this repository) \u00b6 The Royal College Digital Growth Charts Team will establish a Clinical Risk Management File (CRMF) for each safety related healthcare IT system. The purpose of the CRMF is toprovide a central repository where all safety related information pertaining to the healthcare IT system is stored and controlled. This GitHub repository contains out Clinical Risk Management File. Clinical Risk Management Plan (this document) \u00b6 The Royal College Digital Growth Charts Team will establish a Clinical Risk Management Plan (CRMP) for each safety related healthcare IT system. The purpose of the CRMP is to identify the clinical risk management activities that are to be undertaken and the phasing of these activities in the project lifecycle. The CRMP will also identify the resources required to discharge these clinical risk management activities. Hazard Log \u00b6 The Royal College Digital Growth Charts Team will establish and maintain a Hazard Log (HL) for each safety related healthcare IT system. The HL will be controlled and configured in accordance with the Organisation document control /quality management policy [provide a reference]. Clinical Safety Case \u00b6 The Royal College Digital Growth Charts Team will establish and develop a Clinical Safety Case (CSC) for each safety related HIT system: RCPCH dGC Application Programming Interface RCPCH Demo React Client (not for direct clinical use) RCPCH React Component Clinical Safety Case Report \u00b6 The Royal College Digital Growth Charts Team will issue a Clinical Safety Case Report (CSCR) for each safety related healthcare IT system. The CSCR will be issued to support initial deployment and will be updated during the lifecycle of the healthcare IT system should the safety characteristics change. The CSCR will be controlled and configured in accordance with the Organisation\u2019s document control policy [provide a reference]. The HL will be made available within the CRMF. Healthcare IT Clinical Risk Management Activities \u00b6 Hazard Identification \u00b6 The Royal College Digital Growth Charts Team will conduct hazard identification workshops to identify potential hazards associated with the deployment and use of our healthcare IT system. The CSO will be responsible for facilitating such workshops and ensuring attendance from the Royal College Digital Growth Charts team. Typically, representatives from the following domains will be required: Technical testing team User research and User Experience team Clinical testing team Statistical support Project Board The workshops will have minutes taken and a copy stored in the CRMF . If a healthcare IT solution is deemed not to be safety related then this decision will be formally recorded. The technical team will advise on the best mechanism for addition of new issues to the the Royal College Digital Growth Charts Team's project management workflow. Where any third-party components are used to support the healthcare IT system then they will be considered in the scope of the hazard identification activities and subsequent risk assessment. Where none areused a positive declaration to this effect will be recorded in the minutes. All identified hazards will be recorded in the Hazard Log. Risk Assessment \u00b6 the Royal College Digital Growth Charts Team's Health will conduct healthcare IT system risk assessment inaccordance with the Risk Management Strategy. The Hazard Log will be updated to capture the risk assessment. Risk Evaluation \u00b6 The Royal College Digital Growth Charts Team will conduct healthcare IT system risk evaluation inaccordance with the Risk Management Strategy The Hazard Log will be updated to capture the risk evaluation. Risk Control \u00b6 Where the initial risk evaluation is deemed unacceptable, further risk controls will be required. the Royal College Digital Growth Charts Team will manage healthcare IT system risk in accordance with the Risk Management Strategy. Details of the risk control measure and evidence of effective implementation will be captured in the Hazard Log. Deployment and Ongoing Maintenance \u00b6 To support clinical safety activities undertaken during any deployment phases of a project or programme of work the following documentation will be required to form a part of the overall approval process. Deployment of changes to any of the RCPCH dGC health IT systems follows an industry-standard pattern of 'code promotion' using a Git Branch-based strategy. New features are developed in branches specific to that feature. Following successful testing, user acceptance, and automated tests, a successful feature can be merged into the next branch 'up' which may be an 'alpha' or other nomenclature. The process of merging requires code review by nominated individuals and is a further opportunity for clinical safety review. Code in the 'live' branch is changed relatively infrequently (except for urgent security or safety updates) but the code which is promoted into 'live' wuld have by then undergone several rounds of review as it progressed through our branch promotion strategy. Incident Management \u00b6 Clinical Risk Management activities within the Organisation and thehealthcare IT programmes and services offered are completed within the corporate risk management strategy. As such, clinical safety related incidents are dealt with in a similar manner as other incident within the organisational such as financial,reputational, technical and other service impacting categories. Clinical Safety Competence and Training \u00b6 Overview \u00b6 The clinical safety activities described in this Clinical Risk Management System shall be undertaken by competent staff. Suitable training shall be undertaken by staff to maintain and expand their level of competence. Competency \u00b6 All of the staff identified in the organisation chart, shall be sufficiently competent for the roles and tasks which they are asked to undertake. Where an individual does not yet have sufficient experience or knowledge, then that person shall be monitored, and his/her work reviewed, by someone who has the necessary competence. Such supervision shall prevail until it is judged that the individual has amassed the necessary experience to undertake such tasks unsupervised. In assessing competency, the different functional roles required to fully discharge the obligations of the Clinical Risk Management System,and the necessary skills and knowledge needed for each, shall be considered. Primary functional roles may include: - Conducting discrete safety analyses (for example, a HAZOP or FFA) or defining the Hazard Risk Indicators for a particular project. Making a valid judgement on the safety tasks, activities and techniques required for a given Health Software Product in order to justify the comprehensiveness and completeness of the safety assessment and produce the safety argument with supporting evidence. Assurance of safety assessments and healthcare IT software products. Performance of safety techniques and development of the safety argument for a particular healthcare IT software product must be independent to any assurance activities for the same. Improving and refining the overall Clinical Risk Management System, for example, audit, process change, quality. Ownership and leadership, for example, ultimate safety accountability, culture change, influencing and strategic direction. The first test in establishing competency shall be at the interview stage where potential staff shall be assessed against the above representative roles and agreed job descriptions. Thereafter, competence shall be monitored through the organisation\u2019s established appraisal scheme. Any perceived deficiencies identified during the course of the work or at the appraised stage, especially during probation, shall be addressed immediately, for example, through the assignment of a competent supervisor or the provision of suitable training. All registered clinicians involved in safety roles shall, as a minimum,have completed an accredited training course. Training \u00b6 As part of the employment process and thereafter through the appraisal scheme, clinical safety personnel will undergo suitable training to develop, maintain or enhance their competency level. Such training can comprise: - \u2018on the job\u2019 training conducted under supervision - Internal training courses - Approved external training courses. All registered clinicians involved in clinical safety roles shall, as a minimum, have completed an accredited training course. Completion of any safety training shall be recorded by the individual on the annual appraisal form. Audits \u00b6 Overview \u00b6 Audits shall be undertaken to ensure that projects are adhering to thedefined safety requirements. Such audits will focus on the ClinicalSafety Team and third-party suppliers. Internal Safety Audits \u00b6 the Royal College Digital Growth Charts Team shall undertake regular internal safety audits to ensure that projects undertaken within the organisation are compliant with this Clinical Risk Management System. These audits shall be conducted and recorded in accordance with the internal quality management procedure. The scope of an internal safety audit will be the formal Clinical Risk Management System and the Organisation\u2019s documentation supporting this document. Supplier Audits \u00b6 The Royal College Digital Growth Charts Team shall undertake regular third-party supplier audits, as a minimum annually, to ensure compliance with their Clinical Risk Management System. The audit shall focus on the Clinical Risk Management System, the evidence which demonstrates its effective operation and any issues arising from the deployment of the healthcare IT products and services. The basis for the audit shall be DCB0129. Supplier audits shall be conducted in accordance with the External Safety Audit Procedure.","title":"Clinical Risk Management Plan"},{"location":"safety/csmf/clinical-risk-mgmt-plan/#clinical-risk-management-plan","text":"","title":"Clinical Risk Management Plan"},{"location":"safety/csmf/clinical-risk-mgmt-plan/#purpose","text":"The aim of the Clinical Risk Management Plan is to ensure that all of the Royal College Digital Growth Charts Team involved with the development, implementation and use of healthcare IT systems are aware of the activities that are required to be undertaken to ensure patient safety is improved rather than compromised from the introduction of healthcare IT systems.

These practices ensure tight security of the code, restricting deployment to the live environment. These security practices are in operation in every part of the 'code chain' from writing the code through to deployment on the live server, and each of the many steps in between. Also within these practices are measures which ensure that the code which is deployed is tested, safe, and does not contain regressions (changes which break a feature) GitHub Repository \u00b6 Security of our GitHub code repositories is exceedingly tight, combining physical security of devices , as well as multi-factor access controls . Login to the GitHub organisation is restricted to specific users, who are in the RCPCH Developer Team, who are all required to use two-factor authentication (username + password + another factor such as Google Authenticator) 'Pushes' of new code to the GitHub repositories are made using SSH Keys which are secure, long, cryptographic tokens held on the computers used to develop the growth charts. Use of the token requires a further password, so possession of the computer alone is not enough to use the computer's SSH key to make a push of unauthorised code to GitHub. Commits of code are 'signed' using GPG (Gnu Privacy Guard - an open source implementation of the PGP protocol). This is a further attestation to the correct identity of the committer of the code. Deployments of the server \u00b6 Deployment is completely automated, meaning no code can be manually added to our Azure WebApps, before or after deployment. Security is handled via long cryptographic keys from Microsoft Azure which are known to GitHub but never made public. GitHub's 'Action' workflow can use this key to authenticate itself to the Microsoft Azure cloud platform, and can push new code from the GitHub repository to the Azure WebApp where it runs as an application and is available as an API. Code 'Promotion' Safety Strategy \u00b6 New code is never deployed to the live branch. Safety mechanisms on the relevant branches of our GitHub repositories prevent direct 'pushes' of code. Instead, new features must be developed on the development branch or in a branch created specially for that feature. From development or feature branches, code is 'promoted', following successful passing of tests for correct operation, to a staging branch, which allows for further testing, and where necessary review and confirmation of interoperation with other components of the dGC products. Once further user acceptance testing and stability tests are satifsactorily passed, this code can be merged into the live branch. We believe that this strategy reduces the risk of errors being introduced into the API code to a very low level.","title":"Deployment Security"},{"location":"safety/csmf/code-security-safety/#code-chain","text":"In order to maintain security and safety, while still enabling 'agile' software development practices, we have carefully built a DevOps (Developer Operations) strategy which is consistent with industry best practice yet is frictionless in practice and therefore easy to comply with.

Login to the GitHub organisation is restricted to specific users, who are in the RCPCH Developer Team, who are all required to use two-factor authentication (username + password + another factor such as Google Authenticator) 'Pushes' of new code to the GitHub repositories are made using SSH Keys which are secure, long, cryptographic tokens held on the computers used to develop the growth charts. Use of the token requires a further password, so possession of the computer alone is not enough to use the computer's SSH key to make a push of unauthorised code to GitHub. Commits of code are 'signed' using GPG (Gnu Privacy Guard - an open source implementation of the PGP protocol). This is a further attestation to the correct identity of the committer of the code.","title":"GitHub Repository"},{"location":"safety/csmf/code-security-safety/#deployments-of-the-server","text":"Deployment is completely automated, meaning no code can be manually added to our Azure WebApps, before or after deployment. Security is handled via long cryptographic keys from Microsoft Azure which are known to GitHub but never made public.

From development or feature branches, code is 'promoted', following successful passing of tests for correct operation, to a staging branch, which allows for further testing, and where necessary review and confirmation of interoperation with other components of the dGC products. Once further user acceptance testing and stability tests are satifsactorily passed, this code can be merged into the live branch.

You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply. Section 4 \u2013 Sui Generis Database Rights. \u00b6 Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material: a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes only; b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and c.

Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You. c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability. Section 6 \u2013 Term and Termination. \u00b6 a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates: automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License. c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License. d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License. Section 7 \u2013 Other Terms and Conditions. \u00b6 a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed. b.

No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor. d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority. Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses. Notwithstanding, Creative Commons may elect to apply one of its public licenses to material it publishes and in those instances will be considered the \u201cLicensor.\u201d Except for the limited purpose of indicating that material is shared under a Creative Commons public license or as otherwise permitted by the Creative Commons policies published at creativecommons.org/policies , Creative Commons does not authorize the use of the trademark \u201cCreative Commons\u201d or any other trademark or logo of Creative Commons without its prior written consent including, without limitation, in connection with any unauthorized modifications to any of its public licenses or any other arrangements, understandings, or agreements concerning use of licensed material.
